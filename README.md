Fires destroy property, cause injuries, and take lives. Waking up to smoke and flames is one of the worst things that can happen to your home. The worst part is that most home fires are preventable. U.S. fire departments respond to a home fire every 86 seconds. Thatâ€™s over 1,000 fires a day also the fire fighters are constantly at a risk of losing their life. Fire spreads rapidly if it is not controlled. In case of a gas leakage there even may be an explosion. To make sure of safeguarding yourself from such unexpected calamities and hazards, you should learn the ways to escape out from it. Apart from some preventive measures that must to be taken to avoid fire there has to be some working mechanism which we need to quickly extinguish the fire before it will spread. So, in order to overcome this issue, Safe guard live of our hero, our system comes to the rescue.
My motive throughout the whole project is to develop an Autonomous working bot which will extinguish these fire using ultrasonic and flame sensor and can be used in different working places to avoid any mishappening. This firefighting robotic system independently detects and extinguishes fire. Water is pumped from the main water tank to the water nozzle with the help of water pump.
